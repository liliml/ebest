Description: ebest provides joint and pairwise empirical Bayes (EB) estimators for population-specific association analysis, 
    while leveraging information from other populations, accounting for both the uncertainty of the estimates and 
    heterogeneity across populations. ebest also provides the conventional meta-analysis fixed effect estimator 
    for combining the estimates across populations.
